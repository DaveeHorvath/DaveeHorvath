# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm *David*, I do cool stuff with code.
I **make** and **break** code for the funny and enjoy it every day.

I am a student @HiveHelsinki.

Based in Helsinki and looking for new stuff to do.
- I am a big fan of new tech and increasing shareholder value
- Coding and teaching are the greatest best things since grilled cheeses invention
- Math is always an option, but never drink and derive

## Do Stuff
Hit me up if there is a CTF to take part in, or some schenanigans to shenaniganise.

As a rule of thumb:
```
git add . && git commit -m "lets test in production" && git push -f -u origin master
```
