# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm *David*, I do cool stuff with code.	:frog: <br/>
I **make** and **break** code for the funny and enjoy it every day.<br/>

I am a student @HiveHelsinki.

Based in Helsinki :finland: and looking for new stuff to do.
- I am a big fan of new tech and increasing shareholder value :technologist:
- Coding and teaching are the greatest best things since grilled cheeses invention :sandwich:
- Math is always an option, but never drink and derive :beers:
